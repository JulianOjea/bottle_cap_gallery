# About The Project

This project is coded on Dart using Flutter.
It aims to build a collection-like app that stores bottle caps. The main focus is to design a simplified and intuitive UI 
that helps the user explorate and interact with the app in the smoothest and most fluid way.

Main operations supported on the app:

- [addbottlecap]
- [Delete bottle cap]
- [Edit bottle cap]
- [View collection]
- [Sort by field]

One of the main challenges of the app is to store the most relevant data of a bottle cap, as is a personal collection,
this data will be introduced by the user. Therefore the next data will be stored for each bottle cap:
- [Image]
- [Brand Name]
- [Type]
- [Description]
- [Country]
- [City]
- [Release Date]
